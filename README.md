# TSPGPRTUNNEL
#Reproducible Workflow for Predicting Young’s Modulus in an Iranian Tunnel Using Seismic Attributes and Comparison with In-Situ Test Results. 
#we used the data set for 50 m ago:14550-14600, E_ed and E_es are calculated by experience method.
#"estimation_Ed__by_GPR.m" and "estimation_Es__by_GPR" are the general codes for prediction the Young’s Modulus in studied area. 
#"percentage_error_based_accuracy.m" is used for the percentage error-based accuracy for estimation of static deformation moduls by our proposed method.
#"rock_mass_classification_estimation.m" is used for the calculation of Young’s Modulus by geomechanical parameters.
#please run the test.m
